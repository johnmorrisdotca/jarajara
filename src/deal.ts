 * off it the way a player would take tiles — two slots that are both free
 * among the slots still to fill — and give each pair of slots a matching pair
 * of tiles. The order they came off in is then a way to clear the deal, from
 * the first pair to the last, so every deal made here can be finished. A
 * layout can run out of free slots before it is empty (two slots stacked one
 * on the other, and nothing else); that attempt is dropped and the next
 * random stream tried, and `MOST_ATTEMPTS` is far more than any layout here
 * has needed (`mahjong.test.ts` measures them).
