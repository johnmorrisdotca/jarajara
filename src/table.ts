/**
 * THE RULES AT THE TABLE. Two to four players share one layout and take turns,
 * each taking one pair of free tiles that match — the solitaire's own move.
 * Every pair scores for whoever took it: the plain suit tiles one, the ones and
 * nines two, a wind three, a dragon four (`pairPoints`), and a flower or season
 * pair two and another turn. When the player to move has no pair to take, the
 * tiles left are shuffled where they lie (as the solitaire's Shuffle does) and
 * the same player goes on. The game ends when the layout is cleared, or when
 * what is left cannot be freed by any shuffle; most points wins, and a tie
 * shares it.
 *
 * Why these rules: taking turns alone would be decided by counting — two
 * players taking a pair each get half the pairs whatever they do. Pairs that
 * are worth different amounts make every turn a choice between taking the
 * dragon now and leaving the next player nothing good, which is a game of
 * reading the whole layout. And everything is face up, so the device is
 * passed with no cover screen: nothing is secret at this table.
 *
 * Pure, like every rule here: each function returns a new table.
