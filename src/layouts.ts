/**
 * THE LAYOUTS. A slot is a tile's top-left corner in HALF-tile units — a tile
 * covers two across and two down — so a tile can sit half over the two below
 * it, as the top of the Turtle does. Written here as rows of tiles, layer by
 * layer, and read in one order (layer, then row, then column): the order a
 * deal is written in, so a slot's number is the same in every browser and on
 * the server.
 *
 * A layout's `size` is its width in tiles, which is what the set-up's board
 * tiles draw as their big number: 8, 9, 10 and 15 across. Three are drawn to
 * fit a phone's width with tiles a finger can find (about 40 pixels across at
 * 390); the Turtle is the classic 144, fifteen tiles wide, and on a phone its
 * board zooms (`MahjongViewport`).
