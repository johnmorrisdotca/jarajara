/**
 * MAKING A DEAL, in the browser, from a seed.
 *
 * The seed decides everything: which pairs of the set a smaller layout uses,
 * where each lands, and — through the block it is drawn from — how the flowers
 * and seasons match (`bonusRuleOfSeed`). Every deal is laid in reverse
 * (`deal.ts`), so every deal can be cleared.
 *
 * THE LEVEL IS HOW FORGIVING THE DEAL IS. Every deal can be finished, but some
 * forgive a careless pair and some punish it, and that is what a player feels
 * as hard. So five deals are laid from the seed and each is played out
 * `PLAYOUTS` times by a player who takes any free pair at random; easy is the
 * deal that player clears most often, hard the one it clears least, medium the
 * one between. A ranking rather than a threshold, so every layout at every
 * level is made in the same few milliseconds, whatever its numbers are.

 * fresh seed of the usual rule is drawn outside it; today's seed (20260929)
